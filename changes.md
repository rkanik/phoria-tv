# landing page (phoria.tv/signup)
* [x] After user uploads image, please show UI which allows user to crop their image
* [x] I love this here, but can we change it to match the notifications UI we have in the adobe XD https://i.imgur.com/dEWCHwk.png
* [x] Not sure if this is something that will happen during the backend code instead, but after user clicks Signup, please automatically forward to phoria.tv/home (which is the user homepage where they see feeds from their subscriptions)
* [x] please change this on all pages to be the same UI https://i.imgur.com/evwZeur.png. Instead of that image please use this one found in the Adobe XD file https://i.imgur.com/jYx4lhQ.png
* [x] missing the text here which shows the user what their URL will be https://i.imgur.com/5Us9lFZ.png Should automatically update with what they are typing
* [x] change button text Signup --> Sign Up
* [x] Missing text from underneath both these text fields https://i.imgur.com/ZgHbkun.png


# User Homepage (phoria.tv/home)
* [x] Lets reduce the UI of the 'User Stories', its far too big https://i.imgur.com/x6zRQa0.png
reduce it to about this scale https://i.imgur.com/2iuIr99.png . Let me know if you need updated adobe XD file.
* [x] in the post component, it's missing the ability to type and send comment https://i.imgur.com/UCDkRMp.png
should look like this https://i.imgur.com/VDvLeYV.png see the Adobe XD file for the correct UI
* [x] It is also missing the Like button, should just be a Heart to the left of Send Tip.
Also double clicking on the image should heart the image and the number of Likes should go up one time.
* [x] Please add the UI for viewing hidden comments seen in the above screenshot i shared.
* [x] MOBILE specific - Is there a way we can fix the text alignment on the comments here ? https://i.imgur.com/vt1RUGY.png maybe comments should start underneath the username.

# Direct Messages + Post Creation
* please add a UI which allows users to post a pay-per-view image / video. For now it can just be a simple prompt "Input how much to view image / video." if user inputs 0, the post should appear as usual. If user puts more than 0, needs to show pay per view UI. Should be in the Adobe XD file already. Please message me if you're unsure. I will design a better UI/UX for this later.
